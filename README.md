# quadropole

We explore the problem of balancing a pole using a quadrotor. Balancing and swing up controllers serve as a good baseline for analyzing control methods and can be important sub-goals in more complicated tasks such as catching or acrobatic maneuvers. We explore different approaches for controlling balancing and attempt to address the issue of handling modeling errors that arise from using controllers on systems that were originally meant for controlling a simpler system representation. We use infinite horizon discrete time linear quadratic regulator (LQR) and optimization based model predictive control (MPC) in our analysis.
